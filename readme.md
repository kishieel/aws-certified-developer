# AWS Certified Developer

Welcome to the AWS Certified Developer repository! This project is dedicated to providing practical examples, valuable tips, and insightful information about AWS services. Our goal is to support learners preparing for the AWS Certified Developer exam by offering a wealth of resources that highlight best practices and real-world scenarios.

## Usage

To make the most of this repository, follow these steps:

Browse through the repository to find the directory of the AWS service you are interested in.

Each service directory contains a `readme.md` file with specific instructions on how to set up and use the provided examples.

The examples are designed to be easily reproducible. Use the provided Terraform scripts, CloudFormation templates, or shell scripts to set up the necessary resources in your AWS environment.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for educational purposes. While we strive to follow best practices and provide accurate examples, some resources may be simplified to focus on specific aspects of AWS services. For instance, we might use a less secure EC2 instance or security group configuration to emphasize the monitoring capabilities of CloudWatch alarms.
